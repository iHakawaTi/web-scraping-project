However, Simon helped to break down that internal stigma, reassuring me that seeking help is not only okay, but necessary — even for those of us who work in the system.Simon’s compassion, professionalism, and calm presence left a lasting impact.

Care when on holiday,yesterday,"I was visiting my family in Northern Ireland for two weeks when I developed an infection that progressively got worse. I was in a lot of pain and ended up needing to see the surgical team for an abscess to be drained twice. Despite not having a GP to go to I was taken care of efficiently and thoroughly.Initially my visit to A&E was quick, efficient and all of the doctors and nurses treated me with such kindness and sensitivity. It was clear what was happening at all times, who I needed to speak to and why the surgical team were getting involved. The abscess was unfortunately located in an intimate area but all of the medical staff were very discrete and professional, never adding to my embarrassment and treating me with care and kindness.I was then seen by the surgical team who came down to A&E within an hour which was brilliant. Their bedside manner (Hannah in particular, I cannot express how much her kindness helped) was excellent and I was put at ease when experiencing a lot of pain and discomfort. I was given lots of clear information on how to handle after care and all of my potentially silly questions were answered thoroughly.I returned to Surgical 1 CSAU a few days later and was very quickly seen to. Hannah had remembered me from the previous visit and showed me where to go. Again I was so impressed by all of the staff who treated me. I was given excellent advice and plenty of supplies to help the infection heal fully and quickly. Bedside manner and measures taken to make me feel comfortable and respected were amazing. One nurse even brought me an extra sheet to help me feel less exposed even though there was no one else in the room, that was really thoughtful. I’m sorry I can’t remember her name but she was getting her full licence soon so I wish her good luck!Thank you again to everyone who helped me avoid complete disaster on my holiday and for the excellent care I received.",About:Causeway Hospital / Accident & EmergencyCauseway Hospital Accident & EmergencyBT52 1HSCauseway Hospital / Surgical 1Causeway Hospital Surgical 1BT52 1HS,What was good? bedside manner communication doctors efficient information kindness nurses prompt sensitivity surgical team How did you feel? grateful in pain put at ease

Seeking Therapy due to anxious thoughts and overwhelm,yesterday,"I reached out to Inclusion Thurrock after expressing to my GP that I was feeling increasingly down, anxious, and worried and it was affecting my day to day, and she told me how to self refer on their website (it was very easy!). It took a lot of courage, I was sure there were people out there more deserving of therapy than me. Looking back, I really did need it.My therapist, Emily, has been so unwaveringly patient and kind, there wasn’t a single moment I felt judged or like I didn’t belong. In fact, she consistently and genuinely validated every feeling I expressed, helped me work out why I felt that way, whilst always challenging my perspective and slowly helping to re-program the way I think.I was given small activities to try every week. I must admit, at the time these felt a bit tedious and I struggled to see what I could be learning from them, but you really must trust the process. I was laying the foundation for what would become a new way of thinking, and I still regularly refer to these exercises today.Therapy hasn’t cured my anxiety, I still worry, I still have moments where I feel down. But thanks to therapy, I have the skills to prevent these thoughts, and I know how to challenge them when they do occur.Thank you to Inclusion Thurrock for providing this amazing service, and special thanks to Emily for being so professional and helpful.",About:Inclusion Thurrock (Talking Therapies)Inclusion Thurrock (Talking Therapies)RM17 6NB,What was good? activities helpful kindness non-judgemental patience professional skills therapist How did you feel? thankful validated

Wonderful care and reassurance,yesterday,"I had to go to Causeway recently for a colonoscopy, I was already nervous and anxious what would show. I got my gown on and a lovely nurse Philipa came to get me and introduced me to everyone in the room. They gave me sedation which doesn't put you properly asleep but makes it slightly easier.I had a lovely nurse Hannah next to me the entire time who kept checking in, took my mind off the procedure and ensured the doctor knew when I was in pain so he gave me something again for it, I hadn't even said anything but she picked up on my discomfort and asked me about it and I then felt him giving me something more. She reassured me a lot of patients get sedation for colonoscopies and explained things throughout.The procedure was fine, uncomfortable yes but everyone in the room made me feel so reassured and safe.

It is difficult to know where to start,yesterday,"My son (late teens) has had poor mental health since the age of 4. We have engaged with pretty much every health agency in Oxfordshire, including CAMHS. The fact that this is the go-to service for young people's mental health is truly scary.It is difficult to know where to start with just how bad our experience has been.• The waiting times are often of two years or more.• The treatment offered is of little use, often consisting of online forums and vague parental self help programs that are simply unfit for purpose.• Upon completing a course of this 'treatment' the young person is simply discharged with no follow on care, and no escalation of care if that initial course of treatment has proved ineffective.• We were offered involvement with an online forum. There is no user verification with this forum, meaning that anyone of any age could begin conversations with vulnerable young people. It does not appear to be moderated in any way. A majority of the accounts on it are automated bots with no human involvement behind them. The fact that this is considered treatment for mental health conditions is nothing short of scandalous.• Upon making a complaint, I was told that the CAMHS service was decimated by COVID and lockdown. COVID was over 5 years ago. I would have expected somebody to have dragged the service back into something resembling normalcy by now.

Birth Experience,yesterday,"I recently gave birth in the Ulster hospital and wanted to provide feedback on the care received.I was admitted to the induction bay, which had been preplanned. Stephanie who was taking care of me upon admission and throughout the day was brilliant and took her time to run through and explain everything. I did feel for her however as she was running the bay alone and given how busy it was, I'm sure another pair of hands would have been helpful. Our care was then handed over to Concepta (and another lovely lady who unfortunately I cannot remember her name!) for the evening. It was over the course of the evening that I went into labour and Concepta was brilliant, so down to earth and able to speak with honestly about the situation, which was much appreciated. I still had the choice to proceed to home from home or move to labour ward. As this was my first pregnancy and I was 1. Unsure of how much further pain I would be in, and 2. I didn't want to go to home from home unit and have to return back upstairs, I decided to go to the labour ward as this felt more straightforward.The handover from induction by the other lady (apologies!) to Rae and Gemma in the Labour ward was totally seamless! They sprung straight into action and talked me through the birth, although it was assisted by a Dr with the kiwi ventouse and an episitomy. The reasons for the interventions were explained to me and I was happy to proceed. The care from both ladies was  second to none, they made a brilliant team and I couldn't have asked for better. I was surprised to learn Gemma was close to completing her qualification - you would have thought she had been a midwife for years!I was then moved down to the maternity ward and placed in a side room. Whilst it was nice to have privacy and personal space, I do have to echo another review in that it did feel isolating due to the fact that birthing partners had to leave. I understand the rationale behind this with regards to open bays however I feel the policy should be different for side rooms.If I'd of been in the home from home unit following an uncomplicated birth, I would have had the option to have someone stay, whereas my first night was very difficult and overwhelming - a new-born that wouldn't settle at all combined with no sleep since before admission, as well as an uncomfortable wound. This does not bode well for recovery when you are advised to rest but cannot as you do not have that support.I feel the case could be argued that those with the higher care needs would benefit greater to having the additional support and I personally feel my stay on the ward would have been much more positive should I have been able to avail of that additional support of my choosing. I felt it meant trying to rely on midwives for certain things which was not practical nor a good use of resources in my opinion.Lastly I would like to say that the care from the Healthcare and Nursing Assistants on the ward was really good, they made such a difference - for one they advised that breakfast was self serve which I didn't know and at first assumed I'd been forgotten about! Also Lesley who was the midwife overseeing my care upon my day of discharge, she was great and was able to offer great advice on any queries I had.Overall I would say my experience was excellent in the Ulster with the only negative/thing I would change being that of the policy on overnight stays on the maternity ward and would welcome this to be reviewed.",About:Maternity / Labour Ward / Delivery SuiteMaternity Labour Ward / Delivery SuiteBT16 1RHThe Ulster Hospital / MaternityThe Ulster Hospital MaternityBT16 1RH,What was good? care communication doctor explained everything healthcare assistants midwifery student What could be improved? overnight care policy side room How did you feel? isolated overwhelmed satisfied

Minor stroke,yesterday,"My wife suffered a mild stroke and spent a night on Clyst Ward at the RD&E in June. The staff and her treatment on the ward cannot be faulted, though she needed very little care or attention.The bedside manner and advice from the stroke specialists were spot on, though it is a quandary as to why their visits to the wards are still, after all these years, limited to the late afternoon, extending an overnight visit to 2 days and 1 night.The follow-up with a specialist required a return journey to the RD&E and interruption to our regular day. The attendance of an active receptionist in the waiting room outside Clyst Ward was unnecessary, and frankly their manner of engagement and conversation made us uncomfortable. Not all people want to share their personal stories or experiences about the event, and it did not reduce our anxiety. Much more discreet to allow the waiting patients to exchange smiles, greetings or stories on their own accord.The appearance of a trainee doctor and the rather public request that they sit in on the session with the specialist was also uncomfortable. The specialist was late for the appointment and chatted outside to a nurse for several minutes, then told them they won't be long.The advice they provided in the appointment was excellent, but again, should have been limited to the three of us. We are also wondering why such sessions cannot be conducted over the phone in the comfort of the client's own home.

"Gentle, informed, child-centred care",yesterday,"My 5-year-old daughter was recently admitted for vent surgery. Our experience at UHD Day Procedure Unit was an exceptional example of gentle, informed, child-centred care.Prior to surgery, I was emailed advice as to how to prepare my daughter for anaesthesia and details about the risks of surgery. This was helpful and aided the consent process on the day as I had already considered this information.The nursing teams, from pre-op, telephone assessment, ward level, theatre and recovery where gold standard. My daughter was attended to thoroughly, professionally and warmly every step of the way and this dramatically increased her compliance and comfort in undergoing her procedure. Of note, there was a calming member of support staff who I was grateful for in supporting me after my daughter was put under anaesthetic, a time when a lot of parents get a bit wobbly.The theatre team worked with a calm manner that made the expertise of what they were doing look incredibly easy whilst engaging and reassuring a nervous child (and Mum). I was prepared for my daughter to have various responses to the anaesthetic process, but thankfully it went as well as it could.The nursing team supported my daughter to hold her teddy bear and administer pretend strawberry air, following which my daughter self applied her own mask and was calmly supported by Chris, her anaesthetist, and his consultant colleague. Chris (who had already built a good rapport with her prior to surgery) engaged her with jokes about what flavours the air might be in the mask....cheese and onion was suggested. My daughter was engaged and calm until she fell asleep. I felt confident she would be cared for well as I left her for the operation.In regards to the ENT team, my daughter had been seen by audiologists and consultant Mr Toner prior to admission for initial assessments and everyone was kind and professional.Mr Elsherrif the ENT surgeon carried out the surgery on the day and he was an experienced, warm and professional presence who updated me clearly pre and post operatively.I am very grateful for the impact that the procedure has had on my daughter already. My daughter complained of no pain after the surgery and for the remainder of the day; her hearing was also immediately improved.As a health professional, I know first hand the strains of working in the health service, and that's why I hope it is enthusiastically communicated to the relevant teams, that they make a huge difference.This procedure has had a significant impact on my daughter who told me after the operation that she had been uncomfortable all the time before. I'm reassured to know she will better be able to hear in school now and also thrilled that we already have had a lower volume in our home. Last night as she fell asleep I became emotional as we spoke in gentle whispers as she fell asleep and I knew putting her through surgery was worth it.I asked my daughter if she wished to say anything to the team and she said -  Thank you for the ear drops, I can hear, I love you, bye.",About:The Ulster Hospital / Day Procedure UnitThe Ulster Hospital Day Procedure UnitNewtownardsBT16 1RHThe Ulster Hospital / ENT InpatientsThe Ulster Hospital ENT InpatientsBT16 1RH,"Linda Gibson Lead Nurse, Theatres, South Eastern HSC Trust More responses from Linda Submitted on 08/08/2025 at 15:32 Published on Care Opinion at 15:32 Share this response"
