With the recent ""Covair"" sickness hoax, many left-leaning hospitals are pushing microchip implanted vaccines on unsuspecting dems.

"kk207b","“McKenzie Health Hospital” in Richmond Hill. What was your experience? Ours is shi..y.","We took our father to McKenzie Health Hospital. I have been to a few hospitals and always have had high regard for nurses and doctors for their job is really hard; but this experience showed us not all of them are the same.

- A lot of neglect. An example is: they would leave the food in the room and although my father cannot reach the food, they wouldn’t help him and he has missed breakfast and lunches because of this. And they don’t even allow family member to be with the patient to help him (with COVID excuse)

- they inserted catheter and caused infection. 

- When you ask a nurse something, their first answer is I don’t know! Are you kidding me? If you don’t know, read the notes and then answer. I don’t know means I’m not responsible. Very frustrating.

- The garbage bins are always full, floor is dirty and in a few days that we were there no one cleaned the bathroom or the floor. Very very dirty place.

- Doctors don’t tell you when they will visit. It might take 2 days for a doctor to come. Very frustrating. The general feeling about the doctors is that they are novice and it is very hard trusting them. 

I believe all this comes from management and how careless they are to how their personnel treat their patients.

"1mlmtee","Thoughts on physicians working 24 hour shifts in the hospital?","Curious what nurses think about this. I work Neuro/surgical ICU and we have physicians doing organ transplants and brain surgeries on 24 hour shifts and it just seems insane and unsafe to me. I can't understand why it is allowed.

Last week, I was caring for a liver transplant patient who was very unstable and had received nearly 50 units of PRBCs, nearly 50 units of FFP and I think around 10 units of platelets before the decision was made to go back to the OR. I found out that the transplant surgeon who operated did this liver transplant the night his shift started, another liver in the morning, and had to do a third liver that following evening. However, since my patient needed to go back to the OR he decided to operate on my patient AND start the new liver at the same time. I can't wrap my head around how he can do this safely. I know there are teams of providers and nurses in the OR so he isn't alone, but damn it seems insane to me. Would love some OR nurse perspectives on this!

Also, on a more personal note, I had to have an emergency C-section last December for my first child. My OB induced me at 7am and then performed the C-section at 1:30am the next morning. She had also been back and forth between two hospitals and said she did a C-section just before mine. I had a supposedly rare complication where she left a small piece of placenta in my body so I bled a lot at 11 weeks PP until it was discovered. Anyway, it got me thinking that perhaps the mistake wouldn't have been made if she had been able to work shorter hours and slept? We are all only human after all. 🤷","user_steenmachine92","nursing","2025-08-09 11:08:15","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1mlmtee/thoughts_on_physicians_working_24_hour_shifts_in/","True","nursing"

I'm in the early stages of earning a BSN, but I just keep on hearing horror stories about burnout and long-term stress. It goes without saying that people online are much more likely to complain about their job than talk about loving it, but with nursing you can see how alarmingly high burnout and turnover rates are.

"1mlgyrs","New Grad Career Advise (Peds vs NICU)","Hi everyone! I’m a new grad nurse & need help deciding on what I should do! I applied for a new graduate residency out of my home state in a surgical pediatric unit & ended up getting the job! My goal starting nursing school was always pediatrics, and I do feel like this could help me have a good foundation as a nurse. As excited as I am for this position, part of me is anxious about it being so far from home. My home state is all I’ve known and I’ve never lived by myself. I’ve always wanted to try living independently & part of me felt left out for not moving away for college. However, I’m scared starting a new career & living in a state I don’t know anyone in at the same time would be a a lot of change at once. After I found out I got this job, I also found out I have the opportunity to interview for a residency in the NICU at a hospital at my home state. I enjoyed critical care during school & my clinicals in the NICU were one of my favorites! I could see myself expanding my career in the NICU if I got the job too & it would be convenient to stay home. My main question is, should I take the job in the Peds residency out of state, or should I stay in my home state and start in the NICU? I feel like I could be happy in either specialty, I just don’t want to regret my decision. I’d appreciate any advice from anyone, especially if you left home as a new grad nurse!

"1mlfvyn","Lets all share our most humbling nursing moments","Ive had this story time bottled up inside of me for like a year so now i will share it with a bunch of strangers online!

I love psych nursing and in nursing school (i just graduated) i wanted to get an aide position in psych to get my foot in the door. Unfortunately the only place that responded to my application was one that has a notoriously horrible reputation. I figured i would go for the interview and if the place looks as bad as its rumored to be then i just wont take the job. No biggie. 

So i walk in the lobby on my interview day and its actually really nice inside- they mustve redone the place. Im feeling enthusiastic but i remember that day i was sick as an effing dog so already i wanted to gtfo of there and go home so i can rest. Im sitting in the lobby waiting for the hiring manager to get me for my interview. 45 minutes go by and still nothing. I get up to ask the girl at the front desk for an update and shes very sorry but she doesnt have any answers. Thats when, as my back is turned talking to the girl, a bald chubby guy in his late 50s genuinely walks up behind me and GRABS A HANDFUL OF MY ASS. This is now like top 5 most embarrassing moments of my life. Of course hospital security standing 10 feet away does nothing, but front desk girl stands up for me and tells them what just happened in case they didnt see. The guy speed walked away and got into an elevator so we couldnt catch him. He was already in the elevator before we were done taking 5 seconds of silence to process wtf just happened. They pull me into the back room to look at the security cameras and confirm who it was and what exactly happened. Turns out the guy is a resident and this is a ""common complaint"" for him (???????????!!!!!!) they ask me if i want to make a statement. I said no id just like to do my interview. ANOTHER 2 HOURS PASS AND STILL NO MANAGER. Everyone in security and at the desk is joking about how at least ill definitely get the job after all this. 

Manager finally comes down and we have a 10 minute interview in the lobby. I FINALLY go home and an hour later get the email - I DID NOT GET THE JOB!

Three hours later, she gets wheeled in from the other facility. Banged up pretty good, broken ribs, concussion, lots of bruising, but stable. The second that kid saw her gurney come through the doors, he jumped off his bed and ran straight to her.

I worked in corporate America in a medical research/education administrator role prior to becoming a nurse. I'm currently working as rapid response/ house resource nurse. It's a cake job. I love the diversity and the role. But it's a very low acuity hospital and I'm not growing.  I'm a pretty easy going person. I've never directly managed people, though I do have lots of leadership/mentoring experience. 

My boss has offered me a management position. And I don't know what to do. 

On one hand, I love being a nurse. I love this position. 3 days a week is great for being present with my school aged children. 

On the other hand, my boss is wonderful and if I were to ever learn to be a nurse manager, I would want to learn under her. She's kind and patient and I generally enjoy being around her. I know my boss needs help and I have helped her with some projects in the past. We work great together.  We're a growing department and currently lack support.. My boss easily puts in 50+ hours a week. This might ease up with the new manager position to share that burden, but it might not. 

My ultimate goal is to go back to being a full time icu nurse. Maybe go back to school for my masters in education or informatics for my end of career plan. But that's a still years down the road.

"1mkzt5f","ICU -> IR","Hey everyone,

I’ve been working in a CVICU for a little over a year (since April 2024), which is my first inpatient job after 8 months in an ambulatory center. I feel fairly confident in my skills, have handled or helped out in a couple codes, and while I’m still on the newer side, I want to explore other options to broaden my skill set.

I recently applied for an IR position at my hospital. I’ve always been interested in procedural nursing (OR, Cath Lab, IR), and I landed a panel interview with the charge nurses. The interview went well overall, but one of the more seasoned charge nurses mentioned that I might not have enough experience for IR. She later pulled me aside and said it’s not wise to jump into a department like this so soon, that the hospital doesn’t have the resources to train someone with only one year of experience, and gave other cautions.

The IR manager is not a nurse, but I’ve built good rapport with them. If I do get an offer, I don’t want to come across as incompetent or have leadership feel unmotivated to support me because they think I’m not ready.

I’m looking for different perspectives on this—especially from anyone who has transitioned into procedural nursing early in their career.","user_scantron671","nursing","2025-08-08 16:26:06","3","https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1mkzt5f/icu_ir/","True","nursing"

During my interview for a float stepdown position at a hospital I was told my company insurance would cost me about $1000 out of pocket and has a very high deductible - will likely opt out of it. I'm willing to pay \~$600s for insurance but really want a PPO with OON coverage. Not sure if I see the point of getting insurance otherwise, as I could take the \~$7-8k/year and just save it for visits.

It looks like NYC Marketplace insurance ([https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/)) only offers HMO plans! None of the insurances (even up to \~$1500/month) cover any out of network services. As a healthcare worker this stresses me out very much as I see issues with this all the time (a patient goes to a facility that is covered, but the provider within the facility isn't covered. Or they get bloodwork and send them out to a lab which is not covered. The bills for regular care is in the thousands).

I don't have a partner. I have a history of fainting episodes and have been sent to the hospital for it before - I'm on medications now which should prevent it (\~$15-30 a month self pay, not bad). Also wear glasses. I do have medical insurance at the moment - would I be able to get COBRA afterwards to provide PPO coverage for a period of time? Are there any per diem/part time nurses who figured out a solution to getting dependable healthcare coverage?","user_Rain149","nursing","2025-08-08 14:37:07","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1mkwxpu/part_time_or_perdiem_nursing_in_ny_healthcare/","True","nursing"
"1mkwp3g","interview advice for new grads!","hi! little background:

i just finished my 3rd semester and going into my last at the end of august & graduating in december. so that means job hunting. i'm currently a pct/nurse extern of a 1 year+ at the peds hospital i want to work at. i've gotten my resume beefed up by my school career professionals, etc. i've also gotten my role transition in peds (where i want to be.)

i'm looking to land PICU or Peds CICU. so far, i've been working my butt off with pulling strings and using any connection i can hold onto within my reach. it's worked for me. i have a shadowing and phone screening/interview next week.  my hospital is super big on hiring internally. 

here's my dilemma (grateful to have btw): on my floor you move up don't really have to re interview and we have AMAZINGGGGG management that i don't want to leave but i'm not in love with our floor since it's more acute care and less critical and critical care is the only place i've felt a genuine connection with in clinicals. 

also, i still planned on putting myself out there to adult hospitals that had NICU as well. (can you tell i'm a peds girly?) but i know for sure where i would like to be. 

any advice for landing these? interview tips? any general new grad tips on applying etc? any insight into these units you think a new grad should know?

"1mkwjed","New RN, Need Job Application Advice","Hi everyone! I am a newly graduated RN/BSN. I am 33 years old with two elementary children. I started working with my LPN (triage) in August 2024 at an OBGYN office. Graduated with my associates in December 2024. Awarded my multi-state license in Feb 2025 and started working as an RN at the same office, and Graduated with my BSN May 2025. I started working with my LPN in August 2024 and recently left that job May 2025 due to moving with the military. Husband is military. 



We moved to Virginia from Alabama. We are here in Virginia until December, but we have to possibility of staying here longer (depends on husbands military stuff). I am very passionate in Obstetrics and Labor & Delivery. Due to having 10 months of ""clinic"" experience, hospitals are not considering me as a ""New Graduate"" for job applications, but I still don't meet the experience levels for the regular applications. There were a few ""fellowship"" programs that I applied for that were looking for applicants with no experience, but all of those were denied. 



I'm also stuck trying to decide if trying to get a job is something I should do due to only being here until December (for now). Would this gap on my resume be more hurtful to my job search, or would only being in a job for 6-8 months be more hurtful? I've applied at a few OBGYN clinics as well, but haven't heard back from anyone. I really want to stay in the Obstetrics field and keep my experience relevant to what I ultimately want to do. Ultimately I want to become a Midwife in the future, but I need a break from school.

I travel with my partner and son for my partner’s work, so we’re only in each state for about five to six months.

"1mkr1kz","Nurses who moved to sales","I just wanted to ask for some advice on what the best course of action would be.

I currently have over a decade of operating room nursing experience with 3 of those years being a nurse manager of the sterilisation department (where surgical instruments get processed). An opportunity has come about where they are looking for a Territory Manager in the sterilisation consumable department.

I have had two interviews so far and in the second interview they asked salary expectations. I was honest that I would not be moving for less than my base salary ($150k - I’m happy to negotiate but I haven’t said that yet). Based on the interview they said that it would be close to the top end of their range and gave me the vibe that it might not achievable and they explain commissions, bonuses, car allowances etc.

The reason why I believe I should be paid the same base salary is because as a TM I would be selling the products to customers like myself and I would not need to learn the products as I am the end user. My clinical experience (private and public hospital) and my current network cannot be taught, whereas I know I can learn sales.

My question is have I shot myself in the foot for asking at the top range? And for those nurses who have moved to sales, did you take a pay cut to get your foot into the sales door?","user_MontyIsTheBest","nursing","2025-08-08 09:55:59","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1mkr1kz/nurses_who_moved_to_sales/","True","nursing"
"1mkp7fv","Shift Stolen!","Okay, I've never posted this group before but I feel like I need to vent. I've been working overnight as a supervisor at a community hospital. In October one of the other supervisors retired and I asked for her evening slot. I was told it was my slot but they had to hire somebody to replace me for the overnight shift. At the same time, the manager must have agreed to let another nurse go to evening shift. We both agreed to help with overnights because of a lack of staff. In July, they found somebody to work overnight. Her training is nearing an end so I asked my boss how this was going to work. We had an overnight supervisor retire unexpectedly so we became short on overnight supervisors again. The decision was made to cut the second supervisor on evenings, effectively eliminating my position, which I wasn't told about. I figured it out when I was working on the new schedule and realized there aren't enough mid shift hours for everyone. I'm not part of the union so I can't rely on them to help. I don't really anticipate doing anything, I just wanted to vent and hopefully someone to talk me off the ledge. So far I've resisted the urge to walk out and find a new job, but I'm beyond pissed. The only things keeping me here are that the job isn't bad and the pay is pretty good compared to what I would make as a staff nurse.

"1mkonb6","“Fired” by patient for the first time, feeling bad","Yesterday I had an admit. Male patient with an infected spider bite, but it was speculation that it was track marks since he had a history of polysubstance abuse/requesting narcotics and refusing any other types of pain meds, and had been at the hospital numerous times for the same thing in different places. It got infected because he said he put a needle in it twice to do something with it (I think to pop an abscess from the bite), which he did 2 months ago to a different spot but this new one was way worse.

He just got Dilaudid just before getting sent to the floor and apparently kept asking them for more which the doctor (who saw him in the ER before he came up) denied, but the pt told me he hadn’t received any “in hours”. The way the pain meds were ordered, I couldn’t give him anything for a little over an hour— which I told him and he got angry about me mentioning he got some already but agreed. I gave him his scheduled meds as soon as they filled which included gabapentin for nerve pain, since I still couldn’t give his PRNs yet, but he got mad about that when he asked if any of the pills included something for pain and I mentioned the gabapentin. 

He also said he couldn’t sleep due to the pain, but was drifting off during the assessment (I had to keep waking him up to ask the required questions and to do the initial assessment since it was nearing the end of my shift so I couldn’t wait). We needed urine for a culture but apparently had been holding his bladder in the ER since coming and would also sneak to the bathroom when they were out of the room, and they thought it might be because he’s paranoid of it being drug tested. When I asked about him giving urine, he kept “negotiating” saying he’d only give it after he got settled in, then said after he got dinner, then changed it to after he got a nap, etc. I wasn’t demanding it, just reminding him. Ik as far as the next day he still never gave a sample.

When it came time for his pain meds, he was fast asleep (like I tried to wake him up vocally then lightly shook him and all he did was snore) so I decided to not wake him up. He was still asleep by shift change. The next morning I was told he “fired” me but the night nurse said he was fine to her and nothing like how when I had him. I’m still new to nursing, so what did I do wrong that I can improve on?

"1mkkvlo","New Grad","Hello, I recently starting my nursing job in January on a med-surg unit. I work night shift. Everybody is super nice and helpful but I just feel burnt out. I’m just mentally drained. I feel like I’m ALWAYS at work. I feel like I’m good at the job, I don’t struggle with time management at all, but for some reason I just feel miserable still. The transition from days to nights is also a struggle. I really just dislike the 12 hour shifts at hospitals. I received a $20,000 scholarship from my hospital that requires me to commit to 2 years full time. I am allowed to switch units in that period. I know I don’t want to do bedside for long and my plan is to move on after the 2 years, but it’s been feeling like I can’t make it the 2 years. I’ve been really debating paying back the money so I don’t have to be full time anymore. I don’t know what to do, or where to go. I have been feeling such dread when I know I have work the next day. I cry on my way in and take multiple bathroom breaks to get a cry in at work. If I didn’t have this scholarship it’d be a no brainer, I’d either go out patient or at least part-time. I’m really not sure what to do, just needs advice or words of encouragement.

"1mkjvi8","Rant/advice","Hello, I just wanted to vent to someone who understood the profession of nursing without being judged. I’ve been training as a charge nurse for a couple weeks now. It’s honestly my first time working in the hospital setting. I’ve spent most of my career working in home health, travel nursing with nursing homes, detox centers, surgery centers etc. Today I was training with another charge nurse who had been there for a while. This nurse is an absolute angel she’s nothing but helpful and supportive a very big people person. She’s liked among everyone on the floor. Today she let me run the show and do everything myself which I really appreciate because that’s how I learn anyway. It was a hard day to say the least I, work on a cardiac telemetry floor so it can get crazy. I had admissions from left to right and discharges here and there and it was crazy. I thought I was handling it well, keeping every nurse at the max ratio 1:6. I admit I was running around like crazy and dealing with difficult family members which is expected. Then it came time to make the patient assignment and give report to the oncoming charge nurse. I gave report and I was still making the assignment but it did take me a long while to finish it. In the end I messed it up and I could tell she got frustrated with me. We only had 5 nurses and the max patient cenus it could be was 30 and bed board was trying to give  us five more patients after i called them and said we cant take any more. We ended up having 31 after I finished the assignmen so 1 patient wasn’t assigned and I told her to look at it to see if I did something wrong like assign a patient twice. And all she said was “well why isn’t this patient assigned, now this changes everything because she should’ve been assigned” and she said it in a frustrated and mad tone. And I was like okay I’ll fix it and she said “no I’ll call don’t worry about it” saying it like she was trying to get rid of me. So I just said okay and let her do whatever. Then I was making copies of the assignment so the nurses could see who they have and as I was laying out the assignment on the counter with every individual nurses name highlighted she angrily said “no don’t help” in a rude manner. So I left it at that and did whatever I needed to do to leave because at that point I just felt like she saw me as dumb and lost. To make things worse a nurse called out last minute and she got even more frustrated because now she had to take on patients herself. It was my first time running the floor and it couldn’t have been a worse day. To make things worse I over heard a CT tech cuss and complain about the assignment I made saying it makes no fucking sense. At that point I was there an hour after my shift ended just staying quiet. I just know nursing is hard in the first place and I need to grow thick skin but feeling like everyone was against me really hurts 😕. I have sever anxiety so I haven’t stopped thinking about it and over analyzing everything. I just wanted to rant and have people who know how nursing is give me advice.

On trauma, it was at work every day with q3 overnights at hospital and go home early next day.
On medicine floor service it was work every day with q4 call, go home early post call and at noon on weekends.

Some of the residents who had worked at other hospitals would tell ridiculous work load stories.
The worst two that I remember were:
1) while working on the cardiovascular surgery service, the post-CABG patient that you were following had to be extubated before you could leave the hospital. That means if they were on the vent for five days then you couldn’t leave for five days.  I never asked what would happen if you picked up a second or third patient while the first was still intubated.  The resident told me he would go the garage and call the RT to extubate and then quickly drive away.

2) probably a different hospital, but while on CV  surgery you weren’t allowed to leave the post-CABG unit during the rotation.
Allegedly, someone’s wife had a baby while he was doing his CV surgery month and he went to the lobby of the hospital to see wife and child.  Then he was fired for leaving the unit.

"1mh1v2s","Administrators with clinical degrees should be required by law to spend 25% of their time in patient facing roles","We wouldn't let freshly graduated medical students take care of our family members. Likewise you wouldn't go see a PCP who has been out of practice for 20 years. What do these two groups have in common that makes them such poor people to seek care from? A lack of recent experience. 

These administrators want to lean on their clinical degrees and the alphabet soup that follows them. They want to think those letters mean something about their competency to do they job. The letters are just the mask of Oz. Behind them there is always the same person: a lazy egomaniac. 

Why do we allow administrators to set hospital policies they themselves are excluded from? Why do we trust them to know what policies are best for patients when they haven't themselves laid hands on a patient in over a decade? 

Physician scientists often do the 75/25 split, where they spend 75% of their time doing all the tasks of research and 25% seeing patients. That's just one week a month doing the thing you went to school to do. Not a big ask. There are economic reasons for that, but there are also common sense reasons. You can't be a leader in your field without practicing in it. You can't understand the most pressing problems well enough to propose solutions to them without facing them yourself in the most intimate way: with the patient at the bedside. 

This should be a bipartisan no brainer. No one in hospital ""leadership"" brings enough value to justify them leaving the bedside permanently. This should be codified. I bet you would see things change very quickly if it was.

"1mgs990","What we learned from 18-month absence of residents in South Korea","
The 18-month absence of residents in Korea has highlighted a critical truth: residents are, first and foremost, trainees—not merely a workforce. During this period, their responsibilities were assumed by midlevel providers, who, in many cases, performed tasks more efficiently. Operation times decreased, clinical decision-making processes accelerated, and hospital administration reached a level of efficiency rarely seen before.

The most pressing concern during this hiatus was not operational disruption, but the cessation of physician training. Despite this, most teaching hospitals successfully adapted by reallocating resident roles to midlevels.

As residents now prepare to return to their hospitals, there is a need to redefine the roles of both residents and midlevels. While midlevels will continue to play a role, their presence must be scaled back to accommodate the return of residents.

Attendings must be prepared to dedicate more time and energy to teaching. Surgical times will inevitably lengthen, decision-making will slow, and institutional efficiency will decline. These are not failures of the system but the necessary costs of training the next generation of physicians.

Ultimately, running a residency program should not be viewed as a means to secure inexpensive labor. It is a long-term investment—one that requires sacrificing short-term efficiency for the future of the profession.","user_NobodyNobraindr","medicine","2025-08-03 19:34:30","22","https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1mgs990/what_we_learned_from_18month_absence_of_residents/","True","medicine"

"1mdrtbb","Today, I was a hero","A family came in with their 2mo.  And they were very hesitant about vaccines.  ""Which ones are really important?""

So I went through each disease for which the child would be vaccinated today.

* I told them about diphtheria and the 30% mortality rate, how diphtheria toxin is one of the most toxic substances known, as a single molecule can kill a cell.  I told them about how this disease use to terrify communities.
* They'd already heard of tetanus.  Everyone has heard of tetanus.
* I told them about pertussis and the baby I saw who coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed...until he went into laryngospasm.  We did everything we could.  I will never forget his mother throwing herself at our feet begging us to not say what we were going to say.  I let that family see the tears playing in my eyes as I described the memory.  They needed to know that I am doing this *because I fucking care.* Not because of some quality metric.  
* We'd already discussed how hepatitis B is spread by nonsexual transmission and how in the prevaccine era, as many as 65% of infants born to HBV positive *fathers* had HBV by the tme they were a year old.  We talked about how that is a life sentence before age 1.  
* They know about polio.  
* I talked about the baby I watched die of pneumococcal sepsis.  Another mother at our feet.  Another family destroyed by a microbe.
* I described a cricoidotomy in graphic detail.  
* I was admitted for rotavirus in February of 1979.  I still have the hospital bill for $20.  My mother told me about how sick I was.  And 25 years later, I became a resident and I saw babies with rotavirus.  You could hear the diarrhea from across the emergency department.  We had to do our own IVs at the NYC hospital.  The babies were just so sick and all we could do was keep them hydrated and wait for them to recover.  And then in the fall of 2006 the rotavirus vaccine came out.  And in February of 2008 I was the senior on the floor and... there weren't any rotavirus kids.  It was just gone.

And I asked that mother, now that she'd asked me which vaccines were important, I was going to turn the questions around.  Which ones did *she* think were important?

That baby got every recommended immunization today.   I won.  RFJ Jr. lost.  The parents won; that mother won't be throwing herself at my feet. 

Most importantly, the baby won.

Back story- I will be telling work in the next 1-2 weeks about my pregnancy and impending maternity leave. I work as a PA in the US, outpatient specialty but part of a large hospital system in a suburban area. Our maternity leave policy is ABYSMAL. Outside of short term disability, the company offers only 2 weeks paid leave. Everything additional would be PTO. 

Unfortunately I live in a state that does not offer a state wide policy.

I’ve done some preliminary research and other large hospital systems in the area offer 4-12 weeks of paid maternity leave so I feel like it is very reasonable for the company to at least get to comparable numbers.

""Last Thursday, at a town hall in Jonesborough, Tennessee, a 35-year-old woman shared her story: she was denied prenatal care by her physician because they objected to the fact that she wasn’t married, nor did she plan to be. She’d been with her partner for 15 years and they have a 13-year-old child.

While going through her medical history, the physician told her that because she was unwed, they didn’t feel comfortable treating her, because it went against their values and she should seek care elsewhere. At the time of the appointment, the woman believed she was about four weeks into her pregnancy.""

All this because

""On April 24th, Tennessee’s 2025 Medical Ethics Defense Act went into effect. It gives physicians, hospital systems and insurers, among others, the legal right to deny healthcare to patients based on religious, moral or ethical beliefs.""


I'll be the first to say, we're only hearing her side. But If this is true, the doctor is a piece of shit. I am sad that this OBGYN is one of our ""colleagues."" How awful must you be to do this. I really hope this story blows up, and their practice faces significant backlash. I’m not big on cancel culture, but this is just bad medicine.

"1m4524r","Am I being too sensitive?","I want to receive your feedback about my current job in the ER a tertiary hospital. I've been there for a little over a month. I have scheduled two 24hr and six 19hr shifts on top of the regular schedule. The experience has been extremely tough and my initial plan was to stay until September 30 for two reasons:

1. I’m learning a lot here, more than anywhere else before, and that’s helping me with my MIR exam preparation.
2. I’m saving a lot of money in a short period of time.

But the environment is toxic and hostile, and every day it’s getting harder. Here’s what’s been happening:

* Every morning, there are meetings to discuss the number of patients seen. The manager comes almost every day for the same reason and to take photos.
* During almost every shift, they ask me how many patients I’m seeing, or even call the consultation room at 5-6 a.m. just to check if I’m awake.
* The head of the department publicly says that the last 4-5 doctors hired (including me) are slower and less effective, even though **we haven’t received proper training courses**.
* My coworkers have been hostile since the day I defended myself: they scolded me for going to lunch without asking them first, and I replied that when I’m in CAR (another ER section), nobody asks me if I want to eat. Since then, I’ve become their “target.”
* Yesterday, for instance, they left me about 8 follow-up patients to review and claimed I was seeing too few patients, while they bragged about seeing 9 patients in just 4 hours (which I highly doubt for the simple reason that nurses hadn't provided the files of the patients pending to be seen).
* Nurses disregard my medical orders: I told them about 10 times not to place a reservoir on a cystic fibrosis patient yesterday, yet they did it because “a senior doctor” said so. That leaves me legally exposed.
* Sometimes they lie, saying they “didn’t know where I was,” even though I always work in the same spot (I don’t sit with them because it’s noisy, and the phone rings constantly).
* When I said goodbye this morning, nobody even replied.

On top of that, the shifts are brutal:

* The 24-hour shifts are **completely sleepless**. After yesterday's shift, I feel drunk, staggering, like a hangover (and I don't even drink).
* They tell me I need to talk to them before going to lunch “so the ER isn’t left unattended,” but they don’t do the same for me (it's not all but a few do this)
* I rarely leave on time; I almost always finish much later than scheduled.

I feel like I’ve already been labeled as “the target,” and nothing I do will change that perception. I’m mentally and physically exhausted. My plan was to stay until late September to save money and strengthen my clinical knowledge before focusing fully on MIR prep, but I’m not sure if sacrificing my mental and physical health is worth it.

**What would you do? Should I stay until September or leave now, maybe by the end of July?**

Most posts on ambient AI scribes I can find online are now outdated (yes, just a few months is old on this topic) as things have continued to advance.  Recent updates have radically improved these products.

If you haven’t tried it yet it’s a total game changer.  If you tried it and it felt too much like a prototype give it another go—I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. 

We need a new mega thread. Custom instructions for ambient AI scribes unlock incredible potential but are finicky to prompt engineer—the exciting thing though is it only takes one person figuring it out for the entire community to benefit!

Just as people currently share dot phrases/templates I would love to learn from anyone who has been able to build custom instructions for their notes.  I also think having a place where people can show what they’ve made would really help in picking between the sheer number of different options and make it clear which one is the best.  I would expect all the products to steadily improve over time but I anticipate that customization will be the killer edge that helps one of the companies win over the others.

HERE IS A SCRIPT:

Hello, my name is [NAME], I am a [HEALTHCARE WORKER] and one of Representative [NAME OF REP]'s constituents in [DISTRICT ##]. I’m calling to express my opposition to the One Big Beautiful Bill currently before Congress.

I’m deeply concerned that this bill will harm rural communities in our district. Several rural hospitals within an hour of Chico are considered “at risk” according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center at UNC. These hospitals are lifelines for our residents, and cuts to Medicaid and Medicare in this bill could push them closer to closure.

Low-income, working families in our district already struggle to access care. Taking money away from poor families to fund tax cuts for the wealthy is wrong. This bill would further burden our most vulnerable neighbors and jeopardize health care access for rural residents.

I urge Representative [NAME] to oppose the One Big Beautiful Bill unless it protects Medicaid funding and safeguards our rural hospitals. Please stand up for working families and the health of our community.

So I work at a large children's hospital in the US and am currently involved in the care of a patient with a condition that ultimately will have him in our hospital for several weeks. She needs repeated treatments that are expensive (will probably be around $10,000 just to get the treatment course done), and all the treatments need to be done as an inpatient. She has had (and will continue to get) several MRIs, ongoing ancillary therapists, involvement of several specialists, has spent several days in the ICU and is a high-risk patient that may return, etc. Basically, this kid has an expensive and long hospital course that's going to be followed by an expensive and long bout of acute rehab.
Parents are interesting people. Not unreasonable people at all (with regards to the hospitalization itself) and, in general, incredibly nice and caring parents. They haven't been pushing back on treatment or anything of the sort. Dad stays at home and Mom works, I don't know what she does but the vibe I get is that it isn't necessarily the best paying job.

Nevertheless, I found out today that they do not have insurance. I did digging and I found out that they are involved in a health care sharing ministry plan, and I honestly don't know anything about this nor do I know what it means for the kid. He doesn't have Medicaid or CHIP to my knowledge.

I'm off service tomorrow and I've never encountered this before and I'm genuinely curious on the implications of this on the kid's hospital and rehab course. There were some talks that the HCSM wouldn't cover the rehab, but I guess our LCSW spoke to the HCSM directly and they said they cover it.

I do many peer to peers with insurance to get patients into rehab; I'm pretty good at them at this point and have a (reasonably) high denial overturn rate.  
  
There have always been a handful of calls where it feels like no matter what I do or say, or how clear cut the case is from my perspective, their decision to deny was made before I picked up the phone. But today was the most egregious example I've ever had.  
  
Call from a managed Medicare medical director about a middle aged gentleman with stroke. Severe aphasia but cooperative, mod-max assist, supportive family - really a slam dunk that I was surprised was denied in the first place, but thought would be an easy overturn.  
  
I pitch my case to the insurance doc. Again, there are zero red flags on his chart that would make him unsuitable for inpatient rehab. And lo and behold, the insurance doc agrees with me! She says ""I 100% agree with you. He absolutely needs inpatient rehab, no question, he meets every criteria.""  
  
Great. As I get ready to move on with my day, she continues: ""Unfortunately, I'm just not empowered to approve him at this time.""  
  
Huh?  
  
I pause for several moments and ask, what do you mean? You just said he meets criteria and absolutely needs rehab. She states ""Like I said, I'm just not empowered to overturn this case. I highly suggest you place an expedited appeal, and I will be rooting for you that it gets overturned.""  
  
I was incredulous. I told her that he was a slam dunk rehab admission and reiterated the facts (as if that would help). I asked, how can you agree with me but not rule in his favor?  
  
She told me ""As an individual I agree, but as a (insurance) representative, I'm not empowered to overturn this request.""  
  
I should have pressed harder but honestly I was so stunned that I just sort of mutely ended the call. I've dealt with a lot of bullshit denials before, but they have always at least had *some* argument, however stupid, for why the services were not required. This was the first time I had someone say, yup, you're exactly right, we just don't care.
